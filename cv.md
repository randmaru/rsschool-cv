## Summary

I work at [Antares Software Group](http://antares-software.ru) as a junior Front-end developer, I study in absentia at [Yaroslav-the-Wise Novgorod State University](https://novsu.ru) in the third year in the profile - Computer engineering and Software for automated systems.

I always approach any task responsibly and thoroughly. I am looking for a solution to the problem on my own, if
the search is not successful, I do not hesitate to seek advice from more experienced colleagues.
